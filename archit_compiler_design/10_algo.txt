Initialize: l, r, temp, tempprod, productions
Set i, j, consumed to 0
Set flag to 0

Take user input for the production rule
Extract LHS (l) and RHS (r)

While (sscanf(r + consumed, "%[^|]s", temp) == 1 and consumed <= strlen(r)):
    If (temp[0] == l[0]):
        Set flag to 1
        Create new productions by eliminating left recursion
    Else:
        Create new productions with a new non-terminal

    Update consumed

If (flag is 1):
    Add a production for epsilon to productions

Display the modified productions
