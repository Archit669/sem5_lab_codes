Algorithm for check whether given string is keyword or not.

1. Include Necessary Header Files:
   - The code starts by including three essential header files: `iostream`, `vector`, and `string`.

2. Define the main` Function:
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

3. Declare Variables:
   - `vector<string> keyWords`: A vector that stores C++ keywords.
   
        vector<string> keyWords = {
            "auto", "break", "case", "char", "class", "const", "continue", "default",
            "do", "double", "else", "enum", "extern", "float", "for", "goto",
            "if", "int", "long", "namespace", "operator", "return", "short", "sizeof",
            "static", "struct", "switch", "template", "this", "typedef", "union", "unsigned",
            "void", "volatile", "while"
        };
        
   - `string userKeyWord`: A string variable to store the user's input.
   - `bool flag = true;`: A boolean variable initialized to `true` to serve as a flag for determining whether the user's input is a C++ keyword.

4. Prompt User for Input:
   - The program displays the message "Enter your keyword: " using `cout` to prompt the user to enter a keyword.

5. Read User Input:
   - The program reads the user's input using `cin` and stores it in the `userKeyWord` variable.

6. Initialize Flag:
   - `flag` is initialized to `true` to assume that the user's input is a keyword by default.

7. Iterate Through Keywords:
   - The program enters a `for` loop that iterates through the vector `keyWords` using an index `idx`.

8. Check for Keyword Match:
   - Inside the loop, it compares the current keyword in the vector (`keyWords[idx]`) with the user's input (`userKeyWord`).

9. Keyword Match Found:
    - If a match is found, it sets the `flag` to `false` to indicate that the input is a C++ keyword.
    - It prints "It is a keyword of C++ language."
    - The `break` statement is used to exit the loop since the keyword has been identified.

10. Check Flag After Loop:
    - After the loop, it checks the value of the `flag`:
      - If `flag` is still `true`, it means no match was found, and it prints "It is not a keyword of C++ language."

11. Return 0:
    - Finally, the `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.
